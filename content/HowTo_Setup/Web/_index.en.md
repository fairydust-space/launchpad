If you want to use a browser like [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/), or [Tor-Browser](https://torproject.org/) to chat, there's no setup required. We provide a web based chat application called Element at [chat.fairydust.space](https://chat.fairydust.space).
