### Scheduled maintenance announcements

**Saturday, 2022-08-06, 11:00-14:00 CEST (09:00-12:00 UTC)**  
Migration testing and system maintenance. Expect some downtimes during this timeframe of the Matrix service. There may also be some interruptions to the website availability.

### Scheduled hardware migration

Some of you use a little more space than others for sharing media files via Matrix. That's fine and we've almost run out of storage space. That's why we're moving to a larger server with more CPU cores and more storage space. We're basically moving from DC Falkenstein in Germany to DC Helsinki in [Finland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baHsoEAAMZU) (Youtube).
Some other ideas we've been working on in the background will be announced at a later date, after successful migration to the new hardware.

**Sunday, 2022-08-07, 10:00-22:00 CEST (08:00-20:00 UTC)**  
We're planning on moving our beloved fairydust from our existing hardware to new metal.
This will cause some extended downtime of *all* services.

### Status updates during maintenance downtimes

As usual we'll be posting status updates on our social media accounts and Matrix, since our website will be down as well.

Happy travels,  
your cabin crew &#x1F680;
